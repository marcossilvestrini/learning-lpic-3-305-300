#### üß† Understanding Containers

![container](../images/containers1.png)

Containers are a lightweight virtualization technology that package applications along with their required dependencies ‚Äî code, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files ‚Äî into isolated, portable, and reproducible units.

>In simple terms: a container is a self-contained box that runs your application the same way, anywhere.

##### üí° What Is a Container?

Unlike Virtual Machines (VMs), containers do not virtualize hardware. Instead, they virtualize the operating system. Containers share the same Linux kernel with the host, but each one operates in a fully isolated user space.

üìå Containers vs Virtual Machines:

| Feature             | Containers                   | Virtual Machines       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| OS Kernel           | Shared with host             | Each VM has its own OS |
| Startup time        | Fast (seconds or less)       | Slow (minutes)         |
| Image size          | Lightweight (MBs)            | Heavy (GBs)            |
| Resource efficiency | High                         | Lower                  |
| Isolation mechanism | Kernel features (namespaces) | Hypervisor             |

##### üîë Key Characteristics of Containers

üîπ **Lightweight**: Share the host OS kernel, reducing overhead and enabling fast startup.

üîπ **Portable**: Run consistently across different environments (dev, staging, prod, cloud, on-prem).

üîπ **Isolated**: Use namespaces for process, network, and filesystem isolation.

üîπ **Efficient**: Enable higher density and better resource utilization than traditional VMs.

üîπ **Scalable**: Perfect fit for microservices and cloud-native architecture.

##### üß± Types of Containers

1. System Containers
   * Designed to run the entire OS, Resemble virtual machines.
   * Support multiple processes and system services (init, syslog).
   * Ideal for legacy or monolithic applications.
   * Example: LXC, libvirt-lxc.

2. Application Containers
   * Designed to run a single process.
   * Stateless, ephemeral, and horizontally scalable.
   * Used widely in modern DevOps and Kubernetes environments.
   * Example: Docker, containerd, CRI-O.

##### üöÄ Popular Container Runtimes

| Runtime        | Description                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Docker**     | Most widely adopted CLI/daemon for building and running containers. |
| **containerd** | Lightweight runtime powering Docker and Kubernetes.                 |
| **CRI-O**      | Kubernetes-native runtime for OCI containers.                       |
| **LXC**        | Traditional Linux system containers, closer to full OS.             |
| **RKT**        | Security-focused runtime (deprecated).                              |

##### üîê Container Internals and Security Elements

| Component              | Role                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Namespaces**         | Isolate processes, users, mounts, networks.           |
| **cgroups**            | Control and limit resource usage (CPU, memory, IO).   |
| **Capabilities**       | Fine-grained privilege control inside containers.     |
| **seccomp**            | Restricts allowed syscalls to reduce attack surface.  |
| **AppArmor / SELinux** | Mandatory Access Control enforcement at kernel level. |

#### üß† Understanding chroot - Change Root Directory in Unix/Linux

![chroot](../images/chroot.png)

##### What is chroot?

chroot (short for change root) is a system call and command on Unix-like operating systems that changes the apparent root directory (/) for the current running process and its children. This creates an isolated environment, commonly referred to as a chroot jail.

##### üß± Purpose and Use Cases

* üîí Isolate applications for security (jailing).
* üß™ Create testing environments without impacting the rest of the system.
* üõ†Ô∏è System recovery (e.g., boot into LiveCD and chroot into installed system).
* üì¶ Building software packages in a controlled environment.

##### üìÅ Minimum Required Structure

The chroot environment must have its own essential files and structure:

```sh
/mnt/myenv/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bash
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ etc/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib64/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ usr/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ proc/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tmp/
```

Use ldd to identify required libraries:

```sh
ldd /bin/bash
```

##### üö® Limitations and Security Considerations

* chroot is not a security boundary like containers or VMs.
* A privileged user (root) inside the jail can potentially break out.
* No isolation of process namespaces, devices, or kernel-level resources.

For stronger isolation, consider alternatives like:

* Linux containers (LXC, Docker)
* Virtual machines (KVM, QEMU)
* Kernel namespaces and cgroups

##### üß™ Test chroot with debootstrap

```sh
# download debain files
sudo debootstrap stable ~vagrant/debian http://deb.debian.org/debian
sudo chroot ~vagrant/debian bash
```

##### :üß™ Lab chroot

#### üß† Understanding Linux Namespaces

![linux-namespaces](../images/linux-namespaces2.png)

Namespaces are a core Linux kernel feature that enable process-level isolation. They create separate "views" of global system resources ‚Äî such as process IDs, networking, filesystems, and users ‚Äî so that each process group believes it is running in its own system.

>In simple terms: namespaces trick a process into thinking it owns the machine, even though it's just sharing it.

This is the foundation for container isolation.

##### üîç What Do Namespaces Isolate?

Each namespace type isolates a specific system resource. Together, they make up the sandbox that a container operates in:

| Namespace       | Isolates...                  | Real-world example                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PID**         | Process IDs                  | Processes inside a container see a different PID space  |
| **Mount**       | Filesystem mount points      | Each container sees its own root filesystem             |
| **Network**     | Network stack                | Containers have isolated IPs, interfaces, and routes    |
| **UTS**         | Hostname and domain name     | Each container sets its own hostname                    |
| **IPC**         | Shared memory and semaphores | Prevents inter-process communication between containers |
| **User**        | User and group IDs           | Enables fake root (UID 0) inside the container          |
| **Cgroup (v2)** | Control group membership     | Ties into resource controls like CPU and memory limits  |

##### üß™ Visual Analogy

![linux-namespaces](../images/linux-namespaces.png)

Imagine a shared office building:

* All tenants share the same foundation (Linux kernel).
* Each company has its own office (namespace): different locks, furniture, phone lines, and company name.
* To each tenant, it feels like their own building.

That's exactly how containers experience the system ‚Äî isolated, yet efficient.

##### üîß How Containers Use Namespaces

When you run a container (e.g., with Docker or Podman), the runtime creates a new set of namespaces:

```bash
docker run -it --rm alpine sh
```

This command gives the process:

* A new PID namespace ‚Üí it's process 1 inside the container.
* A new network namespace ‚Üí its own virtual Ethernet.
* A mount namespace ‚Üí a container-specific root filesystem.
* Other namespaces depending on configuration (user, IPC, etc.)

The result: a lightweight, isolated runtime environment that behaves like a separate system.

##### ‚öôÔ∏è Complementary Kernel Features

Namespaces hide resources from containers. But to control how much they can use and what they can do, we need additional mechanisms:

###### üî© Cgroups (Control Groups)

Cgroups allow the kernel to limit, prioritize, and monitor resource usage across process groups.

| Resource     | Use case examples              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| CPU          | Limit CPU time per container   |
| Memory       | Cap RAM usage                  |
| Disk I/O     | Throttle read/write operations |
| Network (v2) | Bandwidth restrictions         |

üõ°Ô∏è Prevents the "noisy neighbor" problem by stopping one container from consuming all system resources.

###### üß± Capabilities

Traditional Linux uses a binary privilege model: root (UID 0) can do everything, everyone else is limited.

| Capability             | Allows...                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` | Binding to privileged ports (e.g. 80, 443)  |
| `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`        | A powerful catch-all for system admin tasks |
| `CAP_KILL`             | Sending signals to arbitrary processes      |

By dropping unnecessary capabilities, containers can run with only what they need ‚Äî reducing risk.

##### üîê Security Mechanisms

Used in conjunction with namespaces and cgroups to lock down what a containerized process can do:

| Feature      | Description                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **seccomp**  | Whitelist or block Linux system calls (syscalls)            |
| **AppArmor** | Apply per-application security profiles                     |
| **SELinux**  | Enforce Mandatory Access Control with tight system policies |

##### üß† Summary for Beginners

>‚úÖ Namespaces isolate what a container can see  
‚úÖ Cgroups control what it can use  
‚úÖ Capabilities and security modules define what it can do

Together, these kernel features form the technical backbone of container isolation ‚Äî enabling high-density, secure, and efficient application deployment without full VMs.

#### üß© Understanding Cgroups (Control Groups)

![cgroups](../images/cgroups1.png)

##### üìå Definition

Control Groups (cgroups) are a Linux kernel feature introduced in 2007 that allow you to limit, account for, and isolate the resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.) of groups of processes.

cgroups are heavily used by low-level container runtimes such as runc and crun, and leveraged by container engines like Docker, Podman, and LXC to enforce resource boundaries and provide isolation between containers.

Namespaces isolate, cgroups control.

Namespaces create separate environments for processes (like PID, network, or mounts), while cgroups limit and monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O) for those processes.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Capabilities

| Feature               | Description                                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Resource Limiting** | Impose limits on how much of a resource a group can use  |
| **Prioritization**    | Allocate more CPU/IO priority to some groups over others |
| **Accounting**        | Track usage of resources per group                       |
| **Control**           | Suspend, resume, or kill processes in bulk               |
| **Isolation**         | Prevent resource starvation between groups               |

##### üì¶ Subsystems (Controllers)

cgroups operate through controllers, each responsible for managing one type of resource:

| Subsystem | Description                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `cpu`     | Controls CPU scheduling             |
| `cpuacct` | Generates CPU usage reports         |
| `memory`  | Limits and accounts memory usage    |
| `blkio`   | Limits block device I/O             |
| `devices` | Controls access to devices          |
| `freezer` | Suspends/resumes execution of tasks |
| `net_cls` | Tags packets for traffic shaping    |
| `ns`      | Manages namespace access (rare)     |

##### üìÇ Filesystem Layout

cgroups are exposed through the virtual filesystem under /sys/fs/cgroup.

Depending on the version:

* **cgroups v1**: separate hierarchies for each controller (e.g., memory, cpu, etc.)
* **cgroups v2**: unified hierarchy under a single mount point

Mounted under:

```sh
/sys/fs/cgroup/
```

Typical cgroups v1 hierarchy:

```sh
/sys/fs/cgroup/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memory/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mygroup/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memory.limit_in_bytes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cpu/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mygroup/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

In cgroups v2, all resources are managed under a unified hierarchy:

```sh
/sys/fs/cgroup/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cgroup.procs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cgroup.controllers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memory.max
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cpu.max
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

##### üß™ Common Usage (v1 and v2 examples)

v1 ‚Äì Create and assign memory limit:

```sh
# Mount memory controller (if needed)
mount -t cgroup -o memory none /sys/fs/cgroup/memory

# Create group
mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/mygroup

# Set memory limit (100 MB)
echo 104857600 | tee /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/mygroup/memory.limit_in_bytes

# Assign a process (e.g., current shell)
echo $$ | tee /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/mygroup/tasks
```

v2 ‚Äì Unified hierarchy:

```sh
# Create subgroup
mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/mygroup

# Enable controllers
echo +memory +cpu > /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.subtree_control

# Move shell into group
echo $$ > /sys/fs/cgroup/mygroup/cgroup.procs

# Set limits
echo 104857600 > /sys/fs/cgroup/mygroup/memory.max
echo "50000 100000" > /sys/fs/cgroup/mygroup/cpu.max  # 50ms quota per 100ms period
```

üß≠ Process & Group Inspection

| Command                 | Description                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `cat /proc/self/cgroup` | Shows current cgroup membership |
| `cat /proc/PID/cgroup`  | cgroup of another process       |
| `cat /proc/PID/status`  | Memory and cgroup info          |
| `ps -o pid,cmd,cgroup`  | Show process-to-cgroup mapping  |

##### üì¶ Usage in Containers

Container engines like Docker, Podman, and containerd delegate resource control to cgroups (via runc or crun), allowing:

* Per-container CPU and memory limits
* Fine-grained control over blkio and devices
* Real-time resource accounting
  
Docker example:

```sh
docker run --memory=256m --cpus=1 busybox
```

Behind the scenes, this creates cgroup rules for memory and CPU limits for the container process.

##### üß† Concepts Summary

| Concept         | Explanation                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Controllers** | Modules like `cpu`, `memory`, `blkio`, etc. apply limits and rules |
| **Tasks**       | PIDs (processes) assigned to the control group                     |
| **Hierarchy**   | Cgroups are structured in a parent-child tree                      |

#### üõ°Ô∏è Understanding Capabilities

‚ùì What Are Linux Capabilities?

Traditionally in Linux, the root user has unrestricted access to the system. Linux capabilities were introduced to break down these all-powerful privileges into smaller, discrete permissions, allowing processes to perform specific privileged operations without requiring full root access.

This enhances system security by enforcing the principle of least privilege.

| üîê Capability          | üìã Description                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `CAP_CHOWN`            | Change file owner regardless of permissions      |
| `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` | Bind to ports below 1024 (e.g., 80, 443)         |
| `CAP_SYS_TIME`         | Set system clock                                 |
| `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`        | ‚ö†Ô∏è Very powerful ‚Äì includes mount, BPF, and more |
| `CAP_NET_RAW`          | Use raw sockets (e.g., ping, traceroute)         |
| `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`       | Trace other processes (debugging)                |
| `CAP_KILL`             | Send signals to any process                      |
| `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE`     | Modify files and directories without permission  |
| `CAP_SETUID`            | Change user ID (UID) of the process             |
| `CAP_NET_ADMIN`         | Manage network interfaces, routing, etc.        |

üîê Some Linux Capabilities Types

| Capability Type | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **CapInh (Inherited)** | Capabilities inherited from the parent process. |
| **CapPrm (Permitted)** | Capabilities that the process is allowed to have. |
| **CapEff (Effective)** | Capabilities that the process is currently using. |
| **CapBnd (Bounding)** | Restricts the maximum set of effective capabilities a process can obtain. |
| **CapAmb (Ambient)** | Allows a process to explicitly define its own effective capabilities. |

üì¶ Capabilities in Containers and Pods
Containers typically do not run as full root, but instead receive a limited set of capabilities by default depending on the runtime.

Capabilities can be added or dropped in Kubernetes using the securityContext.

üìÑ Kubernetes example:

```yaml
securityContext:
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
    add: ["NET_BIND_SERVICE"]
```

üîê This ensures the container starts with zero privileges and receives only what is needed.

#### üõ°Ô∏è Seccomp (Secure Computing Mode)

**What is it?**

* A Linux kernel feature for restricting which syscalls (system calls) a process can use.
* Commonly used in containers (like Docker), browsers, sandboxes, etc.

**How does it work?**

* A process enables a seccomp profile/filter.
* The kernel blocks, logs, or kills the process if it tries forbidden syscalls.
* Filters are written in BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) format.

**Quick commands**

```sh
# Check support
docker info | grep Seccomp

# Disable for a container:
docker run --security-opt seccomp=unconfined ...

# Inspect running process:
grep Seccomp /proc/$$/status
```

**Tools**

```sh
# for analyzing
seccomp-tools 

# Profiles
/etc/docker/seccomp.json
```

#### ü¶∫AppArmor

**What is it?**

* A Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system for restricting what specific programs can access.
* Profiles are text-based, path-oriented, easy to read and edit.

**How does it work?**

* Each binary can have a profile that defines its allowed files, network, and capabilities‚Äîeven as root!
* Easy to switch between complain, enforce, and disabled modes.

**Quick commands:**

```sh
#Status
aa-status

# Put a program in enforce mode
sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.foo

# Profiles
location: /etc/apparmor.d/
```

**Tools:**

aa-genprof, aa-logprof for generating/updating profiles

Logs

```sh
/var/log/syslog (search for apparmor)
```

#### üîíSELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)

**What is it?**

* A very powerful MAC system for controlling access to everything: files, processes, users, ports, networks, and more.
* Uses labels (contexts) and detailed policies.

**How does it work?**

* Everything (process, file, port, etc.) gets a security context.
* Kernel checks every action against policy rules.

**Quick commands:**

```sh
#Status
sestatus

#Set to enforcing/permissive:
setenforce 1  # Enforcing
setenforce 0  # Permissive

#List security contexts:
ls -Z  # Files
ps -eZ # Processes
```

**Tools:**

* audit2allow, semanage, chcon (for managing policies/labels)

* Logs: /var/log/audit/audit.log

* Policies: /etc/selinux/

#### üìã Summary Table for Common Security Systems

| System   | Focus              | Complexity | Policy Location               | Typical Use          |
| -------- | ------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Seccomp  | Kernel syscalls    | Medium     | Per-process (via code/config) | Docker, sandboxes    |
| AppArmor | Per-program access | Easy       | /etc/apparmor.d/              | Ubuntu, Snap, SUSE   |
| SELinux  | Full-system MAC    | Advanced   | /etc/selinux/ + labels        | RHEL, Fedora, CentOS |
