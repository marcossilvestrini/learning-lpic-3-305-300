* Oracle VirtualBox: An open-source hypervisor known for its flexibility and ease of use.
* Parallels Desktop: Designed for Mac users to run Windows and other operating systems alongside macOS.
* QEMU (Quick EMUlator): An open-source emulator and virtualizer, often used in conjunction with KVM.

##### ⚖️ Key Differences Between Type 1 and Type 2 Hypervisors

* Deployment Environment:
  * Type 1 hypervisors are commonly deployed in data centers and enterprise environments due to their direct interaction with hardware and high performance.
  * Type 2 hypervisors are more suitable for personal use, development, testing, and small-scale virtualization tasks.
* Performance:
  * Type 1 hypervisors generally offer better performance and lower latency because they do not rely on a host OS.
  * Type 2 hypervisors may experience some performance degradation due to the overhead of running on top of a host OS.
* Management and Ease of Use:
  * Type 1 hypervisors require more complex setup and management but provide advanced features and scalability for large-scale deployments.
  * Type 2 hypervisors are easier to install and use, making them ideal for individual users and smaller projects.

##### 🔄 Migration Types

In the context of hypervisors, which are technologies used to create and manage virtual machines, the terms P2V migration and V2V migration are common in virtualization environments.
They refer to processes of migrating systems between different types of platforms.

##### 🖥️➡️🖥️ P2V - Physical to Virtual Migration

P2V migration refers to the process of migrating a physical server to a virtual machine.In other words, an operating system and its applications, running on dedicated physical hardware, are "converted" and moved to a virtual machine that runs on a hypervisor (such as VMware, Hyper-V, KVM, etc.).

* Example: You have a physical server running a Windows or Linux system, and you want to move it to a virtual environment, like a cloud infrastructure or an internal virtualization server.
  The process involves copying the entire system state, including the operating system, drivers, and data, to create an equivalent virtual machine that can run as if it were on the physical hardware.

##### 🖥️🔁🖥️ V2V  - Virtual to Virtual Migration

V2V migration refers to the process of migrating a virtual machine from one hypervisor to another.In this case, you already have a virtual machine running in a virtualized environment (like VMware), and you want to move it to another virtualized environment (for example, to Hyper-V or to a new VMware server).

* Example: You have a virtual machine running on a VMware virtualization server, but you decide to migrate it to a Hyper-V platform. In this case, the V2V migration converts the virtual machine from one format or hypervisor to another, ensuring it can continue running correctly.

#### 🧩 HVM and Paravirtualization

##### ⚙️ Hardware-assisted Virtualization (HVM)

###### 📄 HVM Definition

HVM leverages hardware extensions provided by modern CPUs to virtualize hardware, enabling the creation and management of VMs with minimal performance overhead.

###### 📝 HVM Key Characteristics

* 🖥️ **Hardware Support**: Requires CPU support for virtualization extensions such as Intel VT-x or AMD-V.
* 🛠️ **Full Virtualization:** VMs can run unmodified guest operating systems, as the hypervisor provides a complete emulation of the hardware environment.
* ⚡ **Performance:** Typically offers near-native performance because of direct execution of guest code on the CPU.
* 🔒 **Isolation:** Provides strong isolation between VMs since each VM operates as if it has its own dedicated hardware.

###### 💡 HVM Examples

VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine).

###### ✅ HVM Advantages

* ✅ **Compatibility:** Can run any operating system without modification.
* ⚡ **Performance:** High performance due to hardware support.
* 🔒 **Security:** Enhanced isolation and security features provided by hardware.

###### ❌ HVM Disadvantages

* 🛠️ **Hardware Dependency:** Requires specific hardware features, limiting compatibility with older systems.
* 🔧 **Complexity:** May involve more complex configuration and management.

##### 🧩 Paravirtualization

###### 📄 Paravirtualization Definition

Paravirtualization involves modifying the guest operating system to be aware of the virtual environment, allowing it to interact more efficiently with the hypervisor.

###### 📝 Paravirtualization Key Characteristics

* 🛠️ **Guest Modification:** Requires changes to the guest operating system to communicate directly with the hypervisor using hypercalls.
* ⚡ **Performance:** Can be more efficient than traditional full virtualization because it reduces the overhead associated with emulating hardware.
* 🔗 **Compatibility:** Limited to operating systems that have been modified for paravirtualization.

###### 💡 Paravirtualization Examples

Xen with paravirtualized guests, VMware tools in certain configurations, and some KVM configurations.

###### ✅ Paravirtualization Advantages

* ⚡ **Efficiency:** Reduces the overhead of virtualizing hardware, potentially offering better performance for certain workloads.
* ✅ **Resource Utilization:** More efficient use of system resources due to direct communication between the guest OS and hypervisor.

###### ❌ Paravirtualization Disadvantages

* 🛠️ **Guest OS Modification:** Requires modifications to the guest OS, limiting compatibility to supported operating systems.
* 🔧 **Complexity:** Requires additional complexity in the guest OS for hypercall implementations.

##### ⚖️ Key Differences

###### 🖥️ Guest OS Requirements

* **HVM:** Can run unmodified guest operating systems.
* **Paravirtualization:** Requires guest operating systems to be modified to work with the hypervisor.

###### ⚡ Performance

* **HVM:** Typically provides near-native performance due to hardware-assisted execution.
* **Paravirtualization:** Can offer efficient performance by reducing the overhead of hardware emulation, but relies on modified guest OS.

###### 🧰 Hardware Dependency

* **HVM:** Requires specific CPU features (Intel VT-x, AMD-V).
* **Paravirtualization:** Does not require specific CPU features but needs modified guest OS.

###### 🔒 Isolation

* **HVM:** Provides strong isolation using hardware features.
* **Paravirtualization:** Relies on software-based isolation, which may not be as robust as hardware-based isolation.

###### 🧩 Complexity

* **HVM:** Generally more straightforward to deploy since it supports unmodified OS.
* **Paravirtualization:** Requires additional setup and modifications to the guest OS, increasing complexity.

#### 🧠 NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access)

NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) is a memory architecture used in multiprocessor systems to optimize memory access by processors.
In a NUMA system, memory is distributed unevenly among processors, meaning that each processor has faster access to a portion of memory (its "local memory") than to memory that is physically further away (referred to as "remote memory") and associated with other processors.

##### 📝 Key Features of NUMA Architecture

1. **Local and Remote Memory**: Each processor has its own local memory, which it can access more quickly. However, it can also access the memory of other processors, although this takes longer.
2. **Differentiated Latency**: The latency of memory access varies depending on whether the processor is accessing its local memory or the memory of another node. Local memory access is faster, while accessing another node’s memory (remote) is slower.
3. **Scalability**: NUMA architecture is designed to improve scalability in systems with many processors. As more processors are added, memory is also distributed, avoiding the bottleneck that would occur in a uniform memory access (UMA) architecture.

##### ✅ Advantages of NUMA

* ⚡ Better Performance in Large Systems: Since each processor has local memory, it can work more efficiently without competing as much with other processors for memory access.
* 📈 Scalability: NUMA allows systems with many processors and large amounts of memory to scale more effectively compared to a UMA architecture.

##### ❌ Disadvantages

* 🛠️ Programming Complexity: Programmers need to be aware of which regions of memory are local or remote, optimizing the use of local memory to achieve better performance.
* 🐢 Potential Performance Penalties: If a processor frequently accesses remote memory, performance may suffer due to higher latency.
  This architecture is common in high-performance multiprocessor systems, such as servers and supercomputers, where scalability and memory optimization are critical.

#### Emulation

Emulation involves simulating the behavior of hardware or software on a different platform than originally intended.

This process allows software designed for one system to run on another system that may have different architecture or operating environment.

While emulation provides versatility by enabling the execution of unmodified guest operating systems or applications, it often comes with performance overhead.

This overhead arises because the emulated system needs to interpret and translate instructions meant for the original system into instructions compatible with the host system. As a result, emulation can be slower than native execution, making it less efficient for resource-intensive tasks.

Despite this drawback, emulation remains valuable for running legacy software, testing applications across different platforms, and facilitating cross-platform development.

#### 🐧 Xen

![panda](images/xen-panda.png)

Xen is an open-source type-1 (bare-metal) hypervisor, which allows multiple operating systems to run concurrently on the same physical hardware.Xen provides a layer between the physical hardware and virtual machines (VMs), enabling efficient resource sharing and isolation.

* **Architecture:** Xen operates with a two-tier system where Domain 0 (Dom0) is the privileged domain with direct hardware access and manages the hypervisor. Other virtual machines, called Domain U (DomU), run guest operating systems and are managed by Dom0.
* **Types of Virtualization:** Xen supports both paravirtualization (PV), which requires modified guest OS, and hardware-assisted virtualization (HVM), which uses hardware extensions (e.g., Intel VT-x or AMD-V) to run unmodified guest operating systems.
  Xen is widely used in cloud environments, notably by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and other large-scale cloud providers.

#### 🏢 XenSource

XenSource was the company founded by the original developers of the Xen hypervisor at the University of Cambridge to commercialize Xen.The company provided enterprise solutions based on Xen and offered additional tools and support to enhance Xen’s capabilities for enterprise use.

* **Acquisition by Citrix**: In 2007, XenSource was acquired by Citrix Systems, Inc. Citrix used Xen technology as the foundation for its Citrix XenServer product, which became a popular enterprise-grade virtualization platform based on Xen.
* **Transition**: After the acquisition, the Xen project continued as an open-source project, while Citrix focused on commercial offerings like XenServer, leveraging XenSource technology.

#### 🌍 Xen Project

Xen Project refers to the open-source community and initiative responsible for developing and maintaining the Xen hypervisor after its commercialization.The Xen Project operates under the Linux Foundation, with a focus on building, improving, and supporting Xen as a collaborative, community-driven effort.

* **Goals:** The Xen Project aims to advance the hypervisor by improving its performance, security, and feature set for a wide range of use cases, including cloud computing, security-focused virtualization (e.g., Qubes OS), and embedded systems.
* **Contributors:** The project includes contributors from various organizations, including major cloud providers, hardware vendors, and independent developers.
* **XAPI and XenTools:** The Xen Project also includes tools such as XAPI (XenAPI), which is used for managing Xen hypervisor installations, and various other utilities for system management and optimization.

#### 🗄️ XenStore

Xen Store is a critical component of the Xen Hypervisor.
Essentially, Xen Store is a distributed key-value database used for communication and information sharing between the Xen hypervisor and the virtual machines (also known as domains) it manages.

Here are some key aspects of Xen Store:

* **Inter-Domain Communication:** Xen Store enables communication between domains, such as Dom0 (the privileged domain that controls hardware resources) and DomUs (user domains, which are the VMs). This is done through key-value entries, where each domain can read or write information.
* **Configuration Management:** It is used to store and access configuration information, such as virtual devices, networking, and boot parameters. This facilitates the dynamic management and configuration of VMs.
* **Events and Notifications:** Xen Store also supports event notifications. When a particular key or value in the Xen Store is modified, interested domains can be notified to react to these changes. This is useful for monitoring and managing resources.
* Simple API: Xen Store provides a simple API for reading and writing data, making it easy for developers to integrate their applications with the Xen virtualization system.

#### 🔗 XAPI

XAPI, or XenAPI, is the application programming interface (API) used to manage the Xen Hypervisor and its virtual machines (VMs).
XAPI is a key component of XenServer (now known as Citrix Hypervisor) and provides a standardized way to interact with the Xen hypervisor to perform operations such as creating, configuring, monitoring, and controlling VMs.

Here are some important aspects of XAPI:

* **VM Management:** XAPI allows administrators to programmatically create, delete, start, and stop virtual machines.
* **Automation:** With XAPI, it's possible to automate the management of virtual resources, including networking, storage, and computing, which is crucial for large cloud environments.
* **Integration:** XAPI can be integrated with other tools and scripts to provide more efficient and customized administration of the Xen environment.
* **Access Control:** XAPI also provides access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific operations in the virtual environment.

XAPI is the interface that enables control and automation of the Xen Hypervisor, making it easier to manage virtualized environments.

#### 📝 Xen Summary

* **Xen:** The core hypervisor technology enabling virtual machines to run on physical hardware.
* **XenSource:** The company that commercialized Xen, later acquired by Citrix, leading to the development of Citrix XenServer.
* **Xen Project:** The open-source initiative and community that continues to develop and maintain the Xen hypervisor under the Linux Foundation.
* **XenStore:**  Xen Store acts as a communication and configuration intermediary between the Xen hypervisor and the VMs, streamlining the operation and management of virtualized environments.
* **XAPI** is the interface that enables control and automation of the Xen Hypervisor, making it easier to manage virtualized environments.

#### 🖥️ Domain0 (Dom0)

Domain0, or Dom0, is the control domain in a Xen architecture. It manages other domains (DomUs) and has direct access to hardware.
Dom0 runs device drivers, allowing DomUs, which lack direct hardware access, to communicate with devices. Typically, it is a full instance of an operating system, like Linux, and is essential for Xen hypervisor operation.

#### 💻 DomainU (DomU)

DomUs are non-privileged domains that run virtual machines.
They are managed by Dom0 and do not have direct access to hardware. DomUs can be configured to run different operating systems and are used for various purposes, such as application servers and development environments. They rely on Dom0 for hardware interaction.

#### 🧩 PV-DomU (Paravirtualized DomainU)

PV-DomUs use a technique called paravirtualization. In this model, the DomU operating system is modified to be aware that it runs in a virtualized environment, allowing it to communicate directly with the hypervisor for optimized performance.
This results in lower overhead and better efficiency compared to full virtualization.

#### ⚙️ HVM-DomU (Hardware Virtual Machine DomainU)

HVM-DomUs are virtual machines that utilize full virtualization, allowing unmodified operating systems to run. The Xen hypervisor provides hardware emulation for these DomUs, enabling them to run any operating system that supports the underlying hardware architecture.
While this offers greater flexibility, it can result in higher overhead compared to PV-DomUs.

##### vif

In Xen, “vif” stands for Virtual Interface and is used to configure networking for virtual machines (domains).

By specifying “vif” directives in the domain configuration files, administrators can define network interfaces, assign IP addresses, set up VLANs, and configure other networking parameters for virtual machines running on Xen hosts. For example: vif = [‘bridge=xenbr0’], in this case, it connects the VM’s network interface to the Xen bridge named “xenbr0”.

#### 🧠 Understanding containers

![container](images/containers1.png)

containers are a lightweight virtualization technology that package applications along with their required dependencies — code, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files — into isolated, portable, and reproducible units.

> In simple terms: a container is a self-containerd box that runs your application the same way, anywhere.

##### 💡 What Is a container?

Unlike Virtual Machines (VMs), containers do not virtualize hardware. Instead, they virtualize the operating system. containers share the same Linux kernel with the host, but each one operates in a fully isolated user space.

📌 containers vs Virtual Machines:

| Feature             | containers                   | Virtual Machines       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| OS Kernel           | Shared with host             | Each VM has its own OS |
| Startup time        | Fast (seconds or less)       | Slow (minutes)         |
| Image size          | Lightweight (MBs)            | Heavy (GBs)            |
| Resource efficiency | High                         | Lower                  |
| Isolation mechanism | Kernel features (namespaces) | Hypervisor             |

##### 🔑 Key Characteristics of containers

🔹 **Lightweight**: Share the host OS kernel, reducing overhead and enabling fast startup.

🔹 **Portable**: Run consistently across different environments (dev, staging, prod, cloud, on-prem).

🔹 **Isolated**: Use namespaces for process, network, and filesystem isolation.

🔹 **Efficient**: Enable higher density and better resource utilization than traditional VMs.

🔹 **Scalable**: Perfect fit for microservices and cloud-native architecture.

##### 🧱 Types of containers

1. System containers

   * Designed to run the entire OS, Resemble virtual machines.
   * Support multiple processes and system services (init, syslog).
   * Ideal for legacy or monolithic applications.
   * Example: LXC, libvirt-lxc.
2. Application containers

   * Designed to run a single process.
   * Stateless, ephemeral, and horizontally scalable.
   * Used widely in modern DevOps and Kubernetes environments.
   * Example: Docker, containerd, CRI-O.

##### 🚀 Popular container Runtimes

| Runtime              | Description                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Docker**     | Most widely adopted CLI/daemon for building and running containers. |
| **containerd** | Lightweight runtime powering Docker and Kubernetes.                 |
| **CRI-O**      | Kubernetes-native runtime for OCI containers.                       |
| **LXC**        | Traditional Linux system containers, closer to full OS.             |
| **RKT**        | Security-focused runtime (deprecated).                              |

##### 🔐 container Internals and Security Elements

| Component                    | Role                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Namespaces**         | Isolate processes, users, mounts, networks.           |
| **cgroups**            | Control and limit resource usage (CPU, memory, IO).   |
| **Capabilities**       | Fine-grained privilege control inside containers.     |
| **seccomp**            | Restricts allowed syscalls to reduce attack surface.  |
| **AppArmor / SELinux** | Mandatory Access Control enforcement at kernel level. |

#### 🧠 Understanding chroot - Change Root Directory in Unix/Linux

![chroot](images/chroot.png)

##### What is chroot?

chroot (short for change root) is a system call and command on Unix-like operating systems that changes the apparent root directory (/) for the current running process and its children. This creates an isolated environment, commonly referred to as a chroot jail.

##### 🧱 Purpose and Use Cases

* 🔒 Isolate applications for security (jailing).
* 🧪 Create testing environments without impacting the rest of the system.
* 🛠️ System recovery (e.g., boot into LiveCD and chroot into installed system).
* 📦 Building software packages in a controlled environment.

##### 📁 Minimum Required Structure

The chroot environment must have its own essential files and structure:

```sh
/mnt/myenv/
├── bin/
│   └── bash
├── etc/
├── lib/
├── lib64/
├── usr/
├── dev/
├── proc/
└── tmp/
```

Use ldd to identify required libraries:

```sh
ldd /bin/bash
```

##### 🚨 Limitations and Security Considerations

* chroot is not a security boundary like containers or VMs.
* A privileged user (root) inside the jail can potentially break out.
* No isolation of process namespaces, devices, or kernel-level resources.

For stronger isolation, consider alternatives like:

* Linux containers (LXC, Docker)
* Virtual machines (KVM, QEMU)
* Kernel namespaces and cgroups

##### 🧪 Test chroot with debootstrap

```sh
# download debian files
sudo debootstrap stable ~vagrant/debian http://deb.debian.org/debian
sudo chroot ~vagrant/debian bash
```

##### :🧪 Lab chroot

Use this script for lab: [chroot.sh](scripts/container/chroot.sh)

#### 🧠 Understanding Linux Namespaces

![linux-namespaces](images/linux-namespaces2.png)

Namespaces are a core Linux kernel feature that enable process-level isolation. They create separate "views" of global system resources — such as process IDs, networking, filesystems, and users — so that each process group believes it is running in its own system.

> In simple terms: namespaces trick a process into thinking it owns the machine, even though it's just sharing it.

This is the foundation for container isolation.

##### 🔍 What Do Namespaces Isolate?

Each namespace type isolates a specific system resource. Together, they make up the sandbox that a container operates in:

| Namespace             | Isolates...                  | Real-world example                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PID**         | Process IDs                  | Processes inside a container see a different PID space  |
| **Mount**       | Filesystem mount points      | Each container sees its own root filesystem             |
| **Network**     | Network stack                | containers have isolated IPs, interfaces, and routes    |
| **UTS**         | Hostname and domain name     | Each container sets its own hostname                    |
| **IPC**         | Shared memory and semaphores | Prevents inter-process communication between containers |
| **User**        | User and group IDs           | Enables fake root (UID 0) inside the container          |
| **Cgroup (v2)** | Control group membership     | Ties into resource controls like CPU and memory limits  |

##### 🧪 Visual Analogy

![linux-namespaces](images/linux-namespaces.png)

Imagine a shared office building:

* All tenants share the same foundation (Linux kernel).
* Each company has its own office (namespace): different locks, furniture, phone lines, and company name.
* To each tenant, it feels like their own building.

That's exactly how containers experience the system — isolated, yet efficient.

##### 🔧 How containers Use Namespaces

When you run a container (e.g., with Docker or Podman), the runtime creates a new set of namespaces:

```bash
docker run -it --rm alpine sh
```

This command gives the process:

* A new PID namespace → it's process 1 inside the container.
* A new network namespace → its own virtual Ethernet.
* A mount namespace → a container-specific root filesystem.
* Other namespaces depending on configuration (user, IPC, etc.)

The result: a lightweight, isolated runtime environment that behaves like a separate system.

##### ⚙️ Complementary Kernel Features

Namespaces hide resources from containers. But to control how much they can use and what they can do, we need additional mechanisms:

###### 🔩 Cgroups (Control Groups)

Cgroups allow the kernel to limit, prioritize, and monitor resource usage across process groups.

| Resource     | Use case examples              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| CPU          | Limit CPU time per container   |
| Memory       | Cap RAM usage                  |
| Disk I/O     | Throttle read/write operations |
| Network (v2) | Bandwidth restrictions         |

🛡️ Prevents the "noisy neighbor" problem by stopping one container from consuming all system resources.

###### 🧱 Capabilities

Traditional Linux uses a binary privilege model: root (UID 0) can do everything, everyone else is limited.

| Capability               | Allows...                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` | Binding to privileged ports (e.g. 80, 443)  |
| `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`        | A powerful catch-all for system admin tasks |
| `CAP_KILL`             | Sending signals to arbitrary processes      |

By dropping unnecessary capabilities, containers can run with only what they need — reducing risk.

##### 🔐 Security Mechanisms

Used in conjunction with namespaces and cgroups to lock down what a containerized process can do:

| Feature            | Description                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **seccomp**  | Whitelist or block Linux system calls (syscalls)            |
| **AppArmor** | Apply per-application security profiles                     |
| **SELinux**  | Enforce Mandatory Access Control with tight system policies |

##### 🧠 Summary for Beginners

> ✅ Namespaces isolate what a container can see
> ✅ Cgroups control what it can use
> ✅ Capabilities and security modules define what it can do

Together, these kernel features form the technical backbone of container isolation — enabling high-density, secure, and efficient application deployment without full VMs.

#### 🧩 Understanding Cgroups (Control Groups)

![cgroups](images/cgroups1.png)

##### 📌 Definition

Control Groups (cgroups) are a Linux kernel feature introduced in 2007 that allow you to limit, account for, and isolate the resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.) of groups of processes.

cgroups are heavily used by low-level container runtimes such as runc and crun, and leveraged by container engines like Docker, Podman, and LXC to enforce resource boundaries and provide isolation between containers.

Namespaces isolate, cgroups control.

Namespaces create separate environments for processes (like PID, network, or mounts), while cgroups limit and monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O) for those processes.

⚙️ Key Capabilities

| Feature                     | Description                                              |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Resource Limiting** | Impose limits on how much of a resource a group can use  |
| **Prioritization**    | Allocate more CPU/IO priority to some groups over others |
| **Accounting**        | Track usage of resources per group                       |
| **Control**           | Suspend, resume, or kill processes in bulk               |
| **Isolation**         | Prevent resource starvation between groups               |

##### 📦 Subsystems (Controllers)

cgroups operate through controllers, each responsible for managing one type of resource:

| Subsystem   | Description                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `cpu`     | Controls CPU scheduling             |
| `cpuacct` | Generates CPU usage reports         |
| `memory`  | Limits and accounts memory usage    |
| `blkio`   | Limits block device I/O             |
| `devices` | Controls access to devices          |
| `freezer` | Suspends/resumes execution of tasks |
| `net_cls` | Tags packets for traffic shaping    |
| `ns`      | Manages namespace access (rare)     |

##### 📂 Filesystem Layout

cgroups are exposed through the virtual filesystem under /sys/fs/cgroup.

Depending on the version:

* **cgroups v1**: separate hierarchies for each controller (e.g., memory, cpu, etc.)
* **cgroups v2**: unified hierarchy under a single mount point

Mounted under:

```sh
/sys/fs/cgroup/
```

Typical cgroups v1 hierarchy:

```sh
/sys/fs/cgroup/
├── memory/
│   ├── mygroup/
│   │   ├── tasks
│   │   ├── memory.limit_in_bytes
├── cpu/
│   └── mygroup/
└── ...
```

In cgroups v2, all resources are managed under a unified hierarchy:

```sh
/sys/fs/cgroup/
├── cgroup.procs
├── cgroup.controllers
├── memory.max
├── cpu.max
└── ...
```

##### 🧪 Common Usage (v1 and v2 examples)

v1 – Create and assign memory limit:

```sh
# Mount memory controller (if needed)
mount -t cgroup -o memory none /sys/fs/cgroup/memory

# Create group
mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/mygroup

# Set memory limit (100 MB)

🧭 Process & Group Inspection

| Command                   | Description                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `cat /proc/self/cgroup` | Shows current cgroup membership |
| `cat /proc/PID/cgroup`  | cgroup of another process       |
| `cat /proc/PID/status`  | Memory and cgroup info          |
| `ps -o pid,cmd,cgroup`  | Show process-to-cgroup mapping  |

##### 📦 Usage in containers

container engines like Docker, Podman, and containerd delegate resource control to cgroups (via runc or crun), allowing:

* Per-container CPU and memory limits
* Fine-grained control over blkio and devices
* Real-time resource accounting

Docker example:

```sh
docker run --memory=256m --cpus=1 busybox
```

Behind the scenes, this creates cgroup rules for memory and CPU limits for the container process.

#### 🛡️ Understanding Capabilities

❓ What Are Linux Capabilities?

Traditionally in Linux, the root user has unrestricted access to the system. Linux capabilities were introduced to break down these all-powerful privileges into smaller, discrete permissions, allowing processes to perform specific privileged operations without requiring full root access.

This enhances system security by enforcing the principle of least privilege.

| 🔐 Capability            | 📋 Description                                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `CAP_CHOWN`            | Change file owner regardless of permissions         |
| `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` | Bind to ports below 1024 (e.g., 80, 443)            |
| `CAP_SYS_TIME`         | Set system clock                                    |
| `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`        | ⚠️ Very powerful – includes mount, BPF, and more |
| `CAP_NET_RAW`          | Use raw sockets (e.g., ping, traceroute)            |
| `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`       | Trace other processes (debugging)                   |
| `CAP_KILL`             | Send signals to any process                         |
| `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE`     | Modify files and directories without permission     |
| `CAP_SETUID`           | Change user ID (UID) of the process                 |
| `CAP_NET_ADMIN`        | Manage network interfaces, routing, etc.            |

🔐 Some Linux Capabilities Types

| Capability Type              | Description                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CapInh (Inherited)** | Capabilities inherited from the parent process.                           |
| **CapPrm (Permitted)** | Capabilities that the process is allowed to have.                         |
| **CapEff (Effective)** | Capabilities that the process is currently using.                         |
| **CapBnd (Bounding)**  | Restricts the maximum set of effective capabilities a process can obtain. |
| **CapAmb (Ambient)**   | Allows a process to explicitly define its own effective capabilities.     |

📦 Capabilities in containers and Pods
containers typically do not run as full root, but instead receive a limited set of capabilities by default depending on the runtime.

Capabilities can be added or dropped in Kubernetes using the securityContext.

📄 Kubernetes example:

```yaml
securityContext:
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
    add: ["NET_BIND_SERVICE"]
```

🔐 This ensures the container starts with zero privileges and receives only what is needed.

#### 🛡️ Seccomp (Secure Computing Mode)

**What is it?**

* A Linux kernel feature for restricting which syscalls (system calls) a process can use.
* Commonly used in containers (like Docker), browsers, sandboxes, etc.

**How does it work?**

* A process enables a seccomp profile/filter.
* The kernel blocks, logs, or kills the process if it tries forbidden syscalls.
* Filters are written in BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) format.

**Quick commands**

```sh
# Check support
docker info | grep Seccomp

# Disable for a container:
docker run --security-opt seccomp=unconfined ...

# Inspect running process:
grep Seccomp /proc/$$/status
```

**Tools**

```sh
# for analyzing
seccomp-tools 

# Profiles
/etc/docker/seccomp.json
```

#### 🦺AppArmor

**What is it?**

* A Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system for restricting what specific programs can access.
* Profiles are text-based, path-oriented, easy to read and edit.

**How does it work?**

* Each binary can have a profile that defines its allowed files, network, and capabilities—even as root!
* Easy to switch between complain, enforce, and disabled modes.

**Quick commands:**

```sh
#Status
aa-status

# Put a program in enforce mode
sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.foo

# Profiles
location: /etc/apparmor.d/
```

**Tools:**

aa-genprof, aa-logprof for generating/updating profiles

Logs

```sh
/var/log/syslog (search for apparmor)
```

#### 🔒SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)

**What is it?**

* A very powerful MAC system for controlling access to everything: files, processes, users, ports, networks, and more.
* Uses labels (contexts) and detailed policies.

**How does it work?**

* Everything (process, file, port, etc.) gets a security context.
* Kernel checks every action against policy rules.

**Quick commands:**

```sh
#Status
sestatus

#Set to enforcing/permissive:
setenforce 1  # Enforcing
setenforce 0  # Permissive

#List security contexts:
ls -Z  # Files
ps -eZ # Processes
```

**Tools:**

* audit2allow, semanage, chcon (for managing policies/labels)
* Logs: /var/log/audit/audit.log
* Policies: /etc/selinux/

#### 📋 Summary Table for Common Security Systems

| System   | Focus              | Complexity | Policy Location               | Typical Use          |
| -------- | ------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Seccomp  | Kernel syscalls    | Medium     | Per-process (via code/config) | Docker, sandboxes    |
| AppArmor | Per-program access | Easy       | /etc/apparmor.d/              | Ubuntu, Snap, SUSE   |
| SELinux  | Full-system MAC    | Advanced   | /etc/selinux/ + labels        | RHEL, Fedora, CentOS |

| Technology                  | Purpose / What It Does                                                                               | Main Differences                                                                                | Example in containers                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **chroot 🏠**         | Changes the apparent root directory for a process. Isolates filesystem.                              | Simple filesystem isolation; does**not** restrict resources, privileges, or system calls. | Docker uses `chroot` internally for building minimal images, but not for strong isolation. |
| **cgroups 📊**        | Controls and limits resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.) per group of processes.             | Kernel feature; fine-grained resource control, not isolation.                                   | Docker and Kubernetes use cgroups to limit CPU/mem per container/pod.                        |
| **namespaces 🌐**     | Isolate system resources: PID, mount, UTS, network, user, IPC, time.                                 | Kernel feature; provides different kinds of isolation.                                          | Each container runs in its own set of namespaces (PID, net, mount, etc).                     |
| **capabilities 🛡️** | Split root privileges into fine-grained units (e.g., net\_admin, sys\_admin).                        | More granular than all-or-nothing root/non-root; can drop or grant specific privileges.         | Docker containers usually run with reduced capabilities (drop dangerous ones).               |
| **seccomp 🧱**        | Filter/restrict which syscalls a process can make (whitelisting/blacklisting).                       | Very focused: blocks kernel syscalls; cannot block all actions.                                 | Docker’s default profile blocks dangerous syscalls (e.g.,`ptrace`, `mount`).            |
| **AppArmor 🐧**       | Mandatory Access Control (MAC) framework: restricts programs' file/network access via profiles.      | Profile-based, easier to manage than SELinux; less fine-grained in some cases.                  | Ubuntu-based containers often use AppArmor for container process profiles.                   |
| **SELinux 🔒**        | More complex MAC framework, label-based, very fine-grained. Can confine users, processes, and files. | More powerful and complex than AppArmor; enforced on Fedora/RHEL/CentOS.                        | On OpenShift/Kubernetes with RHEL, SELinux labels are used to keep pods separate.            |

Summary

* chroot: Basic isolation, no resource/security guarantees.
* cgroups: Resource control, not isolation.
* namespaces: Isolate "views" of kernel resources.
* capabilities: Fine-tune process privileges.
* seccomp: Restrict system call surface.
* AppArmor/SELinux: Limit what processes can touch, even as root (MAC).

#### 🧩 OCI, runc, containerd, CRI, CRI-O — What They Are in the container Ecosystem

##### Overview and Roles

* **OCI (Open container Initiative) 🏛️**

  A foundation creating open standards for **container images** and  **runtimes** .

  *Defines how images are formatted, stored, and how containers are started/stopped (runtime spec).*
* **runc ⚙️**

  A universal, low-level, lightweight CLI tool that can run containers according to the OCI runtime specification.

  *“The engine” that turns an image + configuration into an actual running Linux container.*
* **containerd 🏋️**

  A core container runtime daemon for managing the complete container lifecycle: **pulling images, managing storage, running containers** (calls runc), networking plugins, etc.

  *Used by Docker, Kubernetes, nerdctl, and other tools as their main container runtime backend.*
* **CRI (container Runtime Interface) 🔌**

  A Kubernetes-specific gRPC API to connect Kubernetes with container runtimes.

  *Not used outside Kubernetes, but enables K8s to talk to containerd, CRI-O, etc.*
* **CRI-O 🥤**

  A lightweight, Kubernetes-focused runtime that **only** runs OCI containers, using runc under the hood.

  *Mostly used in Kubernetes, but demonstrates how to build a minimal container runtime focused on open standards.*

##### 🛠️ Practical Examples (General container World)

* **Building images:**

  Any tool (Docker, Podman, Buildah) can produce images following the **OCI Image Spec** so they’re compatible everywhere.
* **Running containers:**

  Both Podman and Docker ultimately use **runc** (via containerd or directly) to create containers.
* **Managing many containers:**

  **containerd** can be used on its own (via `ctr` or `nerdctl`) or as a backend for Docker and Kubernetes.
* **Plug-and-play runtimes:**

  Thanks to  **OCI** , you could swap runc for another OCI-compliant runtime (like Kata containers for VMs, gVisor for sandboxing) without changing how you build or manage images.

#### 🧩 LXC & LXD – The Linux System containers Suite

---

##### 📦 LXC (Linux containers)

* **What is it?**

  The *core* userspace toolset for managing application and system containers on Linux. Think of LXC as **"chroot on steroids"** – it provides lightweight process isolation using kernel features (namespaces, cgroups, AppArmor, seccomp, etc).
* **Use:**

  * Run full Linux distributions as containers (not just single apps).
  * Useful for testing, legacy apps, or simulating servers.
* **Highlights:**

  * CLI-focused: `lxc-create`, `lxc-start`, `lxc-attach`, etc.
  * Fine-grained control over container resources.
  * No daemon – runs per-container processes.
* **Best for:**

  Linux experts who want total control and “bare-metal” feel for containers.

##### 🧪 lab LXC

##### 🌐 LXD

* **What is it?**

  **LXD** is a *next-generation* container and VM manager,  **built on top of LXC** . It offers a powerful but user-friendly experience to manage containers and virtual machines via REST API, CLI, or even a Web UI.
* **Use:**

  * Manage system containers and virtual machines at scale.
  * Networked “container as a service” with easy orchestration.
* **Highlights:**

  * **REST API** : manage containers/VMs over the network.
  * **Images:** Instant deployment of many Linux distros.
  * **Snapshots, storage pools, clustering, live migration.**
  * Supports running unprivileged containers by default.
  * CLI: `lxc launch`, `lxc exec`, `lxc snapshot`, etc. *(Yes, same prefix as LXC, but different backend!)*
* **Best for:**

  DevOps, sysadmins, cloud-native setups, lab environments.

### 🐳 352.3 Docker

![docker-architecture](images/docker.png)

![docker-runtime](images/docker-containerd.png)

**Weight:** 9

**Description:** Candidate should be able to manage Docker nodes and Docker containers. This include understand the architecture of Docker as well as understanding how Docker interacts with the node’s Linux system.

**Key Knowledge Areas:**

* Understand the architecture and components of Docker
* Manage Docker containers by using images from a Docker registry
* Understand and manage images and volumes for Docker containers
* Understand and manage logging for Docker containers
* Understand and manage networking for Docker
* Use Dockerfiles to create container images
* Run a Docker registry using the registry Docker image

#### 📋 352.3 Cited Objects

```sh
dockerd
/etc/docker/daemon.json
/var/lib/docker/
docker
Dockerfile
```

#### 📖 Definition

Docker is an **open-source container platform** that allows developers and operators to package applications and their dependencies into  **containers** .

These containers ensure  **consistency across environments** , speed up deployments, and reduce infrastructure complexity.

---

#### 🔑 Key Concepts

* 📦 **container** → Lightweight, isolated runtime sharing the host kernel.
* 🖼️ **Image** → Read-only template containing the app and dependencies.
* ⚙️ **Docker Engine (dockerd)** → Daemon managing containers, images, and volumes.
* ⌨️ **Docker CLI** → Command-line tool (`docker`) communicating with the daemon.
* ☁️ **Docker Hub** → Default registry for storing and distributing images.

---

#### 🚀 Advantages

* ⚡ **Lightweight & Fast** → Much faster than virtual machines.
* 🌍 **Portability** → Runs anywhere Docker is supported.
* 🛠️ **Rich Ecosystem** → Compose, Swarm, Hub, Desktop UI, registries.
* 🔄 **DevOps Friendly** → CI/CD integration and IaC alignment.

---

#### 📑 Docker Registries

* ☁️ **Docker Hub** → Default, public registry.
* 🏢 **Private Registries** → Harbor, Artifactory, GitHub container Registry.
* 🔒 Use `docker login` to authenticate, push, and pull images.

---

#### Docker Images

![docker-images](images/docker-images.png)

* Concept: immutable package with app, dependencies, and metadata.
* Layers and cache: each Dockerfile instruction becomes a reusable layer
* Builds and pulls share layers.
* Naming: `registry/namespace/repo:tag` (e.g., `docker.io/library/nginx:1.27`).
* Digest: use `@sha256:...` to pin exact content (good for production).
* Image vs container: image is read-only; container is an instance with an ephemeral write layer.
* Basic commands: `docker image ls`, `docker pull`, `docker run`, `docker inspect`, `docker history`, `docker tag`, `docker push`, `docker rmi`, `docker image prune -a`, `docker save`/`docker load`.
* Best practices: minimal base (alpine/distroless), multi-stage builds, pin versions/tags, run as non-root `USER`.

##### Docker Image Layers

In this example, I demonstrate a docker image layers.

In the first image we have a base image of alpine and add one layer.

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM alpine
RUN apk add --no-cache bash
```

The second image I have a my-base-image:1.0 and add two layers, generating a new image with name acme/my-final-image:1.0.

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM acme/my-base-image:1.0
COPY . /app
RUN chmod +x /app/hello.sh
CMD /app/hello.sh
```

![docker-image-layers](images/docker-image-layers.png)

##### Docker image Copy-on-Write (CoW)

In this example, I demonstrate a docker image Copy-on-Write (CoW).

Create a 5 containers from the same image.

```sh
docker run -dit --name my_container_1 acme/my-final-image:1.0 bash \
  && docker run -dit --name my_container_2 acme/my-final-image:1.0 bash \
  && docker run -dit --name my_container_3 acme/my-final-image:1.0 bash \
  && docker run -dit --name my_container_4 acme/my-final-image:1.0 bash \
  && docker run -dit --name my_container_5 acme/my-final-image:1.0 bash
```

See the size of the containers.

```sh
docker ps --size --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Size}}"
```

To demonstrate this, run the following command to write the word 'hello' to a file on the container's writable layer in containers my_container_1, my_container_2, and my_container_3:

```sh
for i in {1..3}; do docker exec my_container_$i sh -c 'printf hello > /out.txt'; done
```

Check the size of the containers again.

```sh
docker ps --size --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Size}}"
```

##### 🐳 Dockerfile Image Instructions and Layers

**📊 Table: Instruction vs. Layer Generation**

| Instruction     | Creates a Filesystem Layer? | Notes                                                                              |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FROM`        | ❌ No                       | Sets the base image; underlying layers come from it.                               |
| `RUN`         | ✅ Yes                      | Executes filesystem changes; adds content that persists.                           |

| `ADD`         | ✅ Yes                      | Similar to COPY, with additional features (URLs, tar extraction).                  |
| `LABEL`       | ❌ No                       | Only adds metadata; doesn’t change filesystem content.                            |
| `ENV`         | ❌ No                       | Defines environment variables; stored as metadata.                                 |
| `ARG`         | ❌ No                       | Build-time only; does not affect final image unless used later.                    |
| `WORKDIR`     | ❌ No                       | Changes working directory; metadata only.                                          |
| `USER`        | ❌ No                       | Sets the user; metadata only.                                                      |
| `EXPOSE`      | ❌ No                       | Declares exposed port(s); metadata only.                                           |
| `ENTRYPOINT`  | ❌ No                       | Defines how container starts; metadata configuration.                              |
| `CMD`         | ❌ No                       | Default command or args; metadata only.                                            |
| `VOLUME`      | ✅ Yes / Partial            | Declares mount points; metadata + volumes in runtime; has filesystem implications. |
| `HEALTHCHECK` | ❌ No                       | Defines health check config; stored as metadata.                                   |
| `STOPSIGNAL`  | ❌ No                       | Defines signal to stop container; metadata only.                                   |
| `SHELL`       | ❌ No                       | Changes shell for later `RUN`; metadata only.                                    |
| `ONBUILD`     | ❌ No                       | Triggers for future builds; metadata only.                                         |

**🔎 Key Insights**

* Most Dockerfile instructions **create a new image layer** — even metadata changes (`CMD`, `EXPOSE`, etc.) are stored as part of the final image configuration.
* **Heavyweight layers** come from instructions that **modify the filesystem** (`RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`).
* **Lightweight/metadata layers** come from instructions like `ENV`, `CMD`, `LABEL`.
* **`ARG` is special** : it exists only at build-time and is discarded in the final image unless used in other instructions.
* To minimize image size:
  * Combine multiple `RUN` commands into one.
  * Use `.dockerignore` to avoid copying unnecessary files.
  * Order instructions to maximize Docker’s  **build cache efficiency** .

#### 🐳 Dockerfile

A **Dockerfile** is a declarative text file that contains a sequence of instructions to build a Docker image. It's the blueprint for creating reproducible, portable, and automated containerized environments.

##### ✨ Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 📜 **Declarative Script** | A simple text file with line-by-line instructions for assembling an image. |
| 겹 **Layered Architecture** | Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new layer in the image. Layers are stacked and are read-only. |
| ⚡ **Build Cache** | Docker caches the result of each layer. If a layer and its dependencies haven't changed, Docker reuses the cached layer, making builds significantly faster. |
| 📦 **Build Context** | The set of files at a specified `PATH` or `URL` that are sent to the Docker daemon during a build. Use a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files. |
| 🏗️ **Multi-Stage Builds** | A powerful feature that allows you to use multiple `FROM` instructions in a single Dockerfile. This helps to separate build-time dependencies from runtime dependencies, resulting in smaller and more secure production images. |

---

##### 📝 Core Instructions

The following table summarizes the most common Dockerfile instructions.

| Instruction | Purpose | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🏁 **`FROM`** | Specifies the base image for subsequent instructions. Must be the first instruction. | `FROM ubuntu:22.04` |
| 🏷️ **`LABEL`** | Adds metadata to an image as key-value pairs. | `LABEL version="1.0" maintainer="me@example.com"` |
| 🏃 **`RUN`** | Executes any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commits the results. | `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx` |
| 🚀 **`CMD`** | Provides defaults for an executing container. There can only be one `CMD`. | `CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]` |
| 🚪 **`ENTRYPOINT`** | Configures a container that will run as an executable. | `ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/sbin/nginx"]` |
| 🌐 **`EXPOSE`** | Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. | `EXPOSE 80` |
| 🌳 **`ENV`** | Sets environment variables. | `ENV APP_VERSION=1.0` |
| 📂 **`COPY`** | Copies new files or directories from the build context to the filesystem of the image. | `COPY ./app /app` |
| 🔗 **`ADD`** | Similar to `COPY`, but with more features like remote URL support and tar extraction. | `ADD http://example.com/big.tar.xz /usr/src` |
| 👤 **`USER`** | Sets the user name (or UID) and optionally the user group (or GID) to use when running the image. | `USER appuser` |
| 📁 **`WORKDIR`** | Sets the working directory for any `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY`, and `ADD` instructions. | `WORKDIR /app` |
| 💾 **`VOLUME`** | Creates a mount point with the specified name and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes. | `VOLUME /var/lib/mysql` |
| 🏗️ **`ONBUILD`** | Adds to the image a trigger instruction to be executed at a later time, when the image is used as the base for another build. | `ONBUILD COPY . /app/src` |
| 💊 **`HEALTHCHECK`** | Tells Docker how to test a container to check that it is still working. | `HEALTHCHECK --interval=5m --timeout=3s CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1` |
| 🐚 **`SHELL`** | Allows the default shell used for the shell form of commands to be overridden. | `SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]` |

---

##### ⭐ Best Practices for Writing Dockerfiles

Following best practices is crucial for creating efficient, secure, and maintainable images.

| Guideline | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🤏 **Keep it Small** | Start with a minimal base image (like `alpine` or `distroless`). Don't install unnecessary packages to reduce size and attack surface. |
| ♻️ **Leverage Build Cache** | Order your Dockerfile instructions from least to most frequently changing. Place `COPY` and `ADD` instructions as late as possible to avoid cache invalidation. |
| 🏗️ **Use Multi-Stage Builds** | Separate your build environment from your runtime environment. This dramatically reduces the size of your final image by excluding build tools and dependencies. |
| 🚫 **Use `.dockerignore`** | Exclude files and directories that are not necessary for the build (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`, local test scripts) to keep the build context small and avoid sending sensitive data. |
| 📦 **Combine `RUN` Instructions** | Chain related commands using `&&` to create a single layer. For example, combine `apt-get update` with `apt-get install` and clean up afterwards (`rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`). |
| 📌 **Pin Versions** | Pin versions for base images (`ubuntu:22.04`) and packages (`nginx=1.21.6-1~bullseye`) to ensure reproducible builds and avoid unexpected changes. |
| 👤 **Run as Non-Root** | Create a dedicated user and group with `RUN useradd`, and use the `USER` instruction to switch to that user. This improves security by avoiding running containers with root privileges. |
| 🚀 **`CMD` vs `ENTRYPOINT`** | Use `ENTRYPOINT` for the main executable of the image and `CMD` to specify default arguments. This makes the image behave like a binary. |
| 💬 **Sort Multi-line Arguments** | Sort multi-line arguments alphanumerically (e.g., in a long `RUN apt-get install` command) to make the Dockerfile easier to read and maintain. |
| 📝 **Be Explicit** | Use `COPY` instead of `ADD` when the extra magic of `ADD` (like tar extraction or URL fetching) is not needed. It's more transparent. |

**Dockerfile example**

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# ---- Base Stage ----
FROM ubuntu:22.04 AS base
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends nginx \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# ---- Production Stage ----
FROM base AS production
COPY ./html /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

#### Docker + containerd + shim + runc Architecture

![Docker shim architecture example](images/docker-shim.png)

##### 🔹 Main Components

* **Docker CLI / Docker Daemon (`dockerd`)**

  The `docker` command communicates with the Docker daemon, which orchestrates container lifecycle, images, networks, and volumes.
* **containerd**

  A high-level container runtime that manages the entire container lifecycle: pulling images, managing storage, networking, and execution.
* **containerd-shim**

  * Acts as the *parent process* of each container once `runc` has done its job.
  * Keeps **stdin/stdout/stderr** streams open, even if Docker or containerd restarts (so `docker logs` / `kubectl logs` still work).
  * Collects the container exit code and reports it back to the manager.
  * Prevents containers from becoming orphans if the daemon crashes or is restarted.
* **runc**

  A low-level runtime (OCI-compliant) that creates containers using Linux namespaces and cgroups.

  After launching the container, `runc` exits, and `containerd-shim` takes over as the parent process.

##### 🔹 Execution Flow

1. **User** runs `docker run ...` → the **Docker Daemon** is called.
2. **Docker Daemon** delegates to  **containerd** .
3. **containerd** spawns  **runc** , which sets up the container.
4. Once the container starts,  **runc exits** .
5. **containerd-shim** remains as the  **container’s parent process** , handling logging and exit codes.

---

##### 🔹 Benefits of the Shim Layer

* **Resilience** → Containers continue running even if `dockerd` or `containerd` crash or restart.
* **Logging** → Maintains container log streams for `docker logs` or `kubectl logs`.
* **Isolation** → Each container has its own shim, simplifying lifecycle management.
* **Standards Compliance** → Works with the  **OCI runtime spec** , ensuring compatibility.

#### ⚖️ Docker vs. containerd

| 🔹 Feature / Component | 🐳 Docker (dockerd)                 | 🐋 containerd                      |

| Footprint              | Heavier, more tooling               | Lightweight, efficient             |
| Ecosystem              | Rich developer tools                | CNCF project, Kubernetes default   |

#### Docker Storage

##### 🧱 Core Concepts

| 🔍 Focus | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Union FS | Read-only image layers + the container's writable layer form a union filesystem; removing the container drops ephemeral changes. |
| Data Root | Storage drivers persist data under `/var/lib/docker/<driver>/`; inspect the active driver via `docker info --format "{{.Driver}}"`. |
| Persistence | Move stateful data to **volumes** (persistent), **bind mounts** (host path), or **tmpfs mounts** (in-memory, ephemeral) to survive container recreation or optimize performance. |

##### ⚙️ Storage Drivers

| Driver | When to use | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| overlay2 | Default on modern Linux kernels. | Fast copy-on-write; backing filesystem must support `d_type`. |
| fuse-overlayfs | Rootless or user-namespace deployments. | Adds a thin FUSE layer; enables non-root workflows. |
| btrfs / zfs | Need native snapshots, quotas, compression. | Provision dedicated pools and use platform tooling for management. |
| devicemapper (direct-lvm) / aufs | Legacy setups only. | Maintenance mode; plan migrations to overlay2. |
| windowsfilter | Windows container images. | Use LCOW/WSL 2 to expose overlay2 for Linux workloads on Windows hosts. |

##### 🧭 Selecting the Driver

* Confirm kernel modules (`modprobe overlay`) and filesystem prerequisites before switching drivers.
* Match driver features to workloads: many small layers favor `overlay2`; filesystem-level snapshots may justify `btrfs` or `zfs`.
* Stick to provider defaults on Docker Desktop, EKS, GKE, etc., to stay within support boundaries.
* Keep `/var/lib/docker` on reliable, low-latency storage—copy-on-write drivers amplify slow disks.

For testing volume drivers use script: [docker-storage-driver.sh](scripts/docker/docker-storage-driver.sh).

##### 📦 Docker Storage Types

**Volumes:**

* Managed by Docker, located outside the container's writable layer (`/var/lib/docker/volumes`).
* Persist after container removal, can be shared between containers.
* Used for data that must survive the container lifecycle.
* Examples:
  * Create volume: `docker volume create data`
  * Use volume: `docker run -v data:/app/data ...`

**Bind Mounts:**

* Mount a host directory/file directly into the container.
* Useful for development, code sync, or accessing existing host data.
* Less portable (absolute paths, host permissions).
* Examples:
  * `docker run -v /home/user/app:/app ...`
  * `docker run --mount type=bind,source=/data,target=/app/data ...`

**Tmpfs Mounts:**

* In-memory mount (RAM), does not persist after container stops or restarts.
* Ideal for temporary data, caches, or sensitive information.
* Nothing is written to disk, maximum performance.
* Examples:
  * `docker run --mount type=tmpfs,target=/tmp/cache ...`
  * `docker run --tmpfs /tmp/cache ...`

**Quick summary:**

| Type       | Persistence | Location | Portability | Typical use         |
|------------|-------------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Volume     | Yes         | Docker   | High        | App data, databases |
| Bind mount | Optional    | Host     | Low         | Dev, integration    |
| Tmpfs      | No          | RAM      | High        | Cache, ephemeral    |

##### 🛠️ Storage Types Usage examples

```sh
# Persistent volume
docker run -d --name pg -v pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:16

# Bind mount
docker run -d -v /home/user/html:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx:latest

# Tmpfs mount
docker run -d --mount type=tmpfs,target=/tmp nginx:latest
docker run -d --tmpfs /tmp nginx:latest
```

##### ✅ Docker Storage Best practices

* Prefer volumes for persistent and backup data.
* Use tmpfs for sensitive or temporary data.
* Document volumes and mounts in Compose/Stack files.
* Monitor disk usage with `docker system df` and clean up orphaned volumes.
* Always check the [official Docker Storage documentation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/) and [storage drivers](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/select-storage-driver/).

For testing storage volumes use script: [docker-storage-volumes.sh](scripts/docker/docker-storage-volumes.sh).

#### Docker Networking

##### 🌐 Core Concepts

| 🔍 Focus | Details |
| --- | --- |
| User-defined networks | Create isolated topologies (`docker network create`) and attach/detach containers on demand with `docker network connect` or the `--network` flag. |
| Network stack sharing | By default each container gets its own namespace; `--network container:<id>` reuses another container's stack but disables flags like `--publish`, `--dns`, and `--hostname`. |
| Embedded DNS | Docker injects an internal DNS server per network; container names and `--network-alias` entries resolve automatically and fall back to the host resolver for external lookups. |
| Gateway priority | When a container joins multiple networks, Docker selects the default route via the highest `--gw-priority`; override IPs with `--ip` / `--ip6` for deterministic addressing. |

##### 🚍 Default Drivers

| Driver | Use when | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bridge | Standalone workloads on a single host need simple east-west traffic. | Default `bridge` network ships with Docker; create user-defined bridges for DNS, isolation, and per-project scoping. |
| host | You need native host networking with zero isolation. | Shares the host stack; no port mapping needed; ideal for high-throughput or port-dynamic workloads. |
| overlay | Services must span multiple Docker hosts or Swarm nodes. | VXLAN-backed; requires the Swarm control plane (or external KV store) to coordinate networks across engines. |
| macvlan | Containers must appear as physical devices on the LAN. | Assigns unique MAC/IP pairs from the parent interface; great for legacy integrations or strict VLAN segmentation. |
| ipvlan | Underlay restricts MAC addresses but permits L3 routing. | Provides per-container IPv4/IPv6 without extra MACs; supports L2 (`ipvlan -l2`) and L3 modes with VLAN tagging. |
| none | Full isolation is required. | Removes the network stack entirely; manual namespace wiring only (not supported for Swarm services). |
| Plugins | Built-in drivers fall short of SDN or vendor needs. | Install third-party network plugins from the Docker ecosystem to integrate with specialized fabrics. |

##### 🕹️ Working with Networks

* Scope infrastructure with user-defined bridges for app components, overlays for distributed stacks, or L2-style macvlan/ipvlan for direct LAN presence.
* Combine frontend/backend networks per container; set `--internal` on a bridge to block egress while still allowing service-to-service traffic.
* Inspect connectivity with `docker network ls`, `docker network inspect`, and `docker exec <ctr> ip addr` to validate namespace wiring.
* Clean up unused networks regularly with `docker network prune` to avoid stale subnets and orphaned config.

##### 🚦 Published Ports & Access

* Bridge networks keep ports private unless you publish them with `-p` / `--publish`; include `127.0.0.1:` (or `[::1]:` for IPv6) to restrict exposure to the host only.
* Port publishing is not required for container-to-container access on the same user-defined bridge—DNS and the internal IP suffice.
* Overlay and macvlan drivers bypass the userland proxy; plan upstream firewalls or routing accordingly.

##### 🔐 Addressing & DNS

* IPv4 is enabled by default on new networks; add `--ipv6` to provision dual-stack ranges and use `--ip` / `--ip6` to pin addresses.
* Each join operation can supply extra identities via `--alias`; Docker advertises them through the embedded DNS service.
* Override resolvers per container using `--dns`, `--dns-search`, or `--dns-option`, or import extra hosts with `--add-host`.
* Containers inherit a curated `/etc/hosts`; host-level entries are not synced automatically.

##### 🛠️ Docker Network Usage examples

```sh
# Create dedicated frontend and backend bridges
docker network create --driver bridge frontend_net
docker network create --driver bridge --internal backend_net

# Launch services with deterministic addressing and aliases
docker run -d --name api \
  --network backend_net --ip 10.18.0.10 \
  --network-alias api.internal \
  ghcr.io/example/api:latest

docker run -d --name web \
  --network frontend_net \
  --network backend_net --alias web-backend \
  -p 443:8443 \
  ghcr.io/example/web:latest

# Attach a troubleshooting container temporarily
docker run -it --rm \
  --network container:web \
  alpine:latest sh
```

##### ✅ Docker Network Best practices

* Model network boundaries early; document which containers share bridges, overlays, or macvlan segments.
* Use `--internal` or firewalls to block unintended egress, and prefer network-level isolation over ad-hoc port publishing.
* When mixing drivers, verify default routes (`ip route`) to ensure the correct gateway won the `--gw-priority`.
* Monitor subnet allocation conflicts when multiple hosts create networks; explicitly set `--subnet` / `--gateway` for predictable CIDRs.
* Cross-check the official docs for updates: [Networking overview](https://docs.docker.com/network/) and [Network drivers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/).

For testing docker network use script: [docker-network.sh](scripts/docker/docker-network.sh).

#### 🐳 Docker Registry

##### 📘 What is a Docker Registry?

A Docker Registry is a stateless, highly scalable server-side application that stores and lets you distribute Docker images. It's the central place where you can push your images after building them and pull them to run on other machines.

##### Key Concepts

* **Registry**: The storage system that contains repositories of images. Examples: Docker Hub, AWS ECR, a self-hosted registry.
* **Repository**: A collection of related Docker images, often different versions of the same application or service (e.g., the `nginx` repository).
* **Tag**: A label applied to an image within a repository to identify a specific version (e.g., `1.27`, `latest`).
* **Image Name**: The full name of an image follows the format: `[registry-host]/[username-or-org]/[repository]:[tag]`.
  * If `registry-host` is omitted, it defaults to Docker Hub (`docker.io`).
  * If `tag` is omitted, it defaults to `latest`.

##### Types of Registries

1. **Public Registries**:
    * **Docker Hub**: The default and largest public registry.
    * **Quay.io**: Another popular public and private registry by Red Hat.
    * **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**: Integrated with GitHub repositories and Actions.

2. **Private Registries**:
    * **Self-Hosted**:
        * **Docker Registry Image**: A simple, official image to run your own basic registry.
        * **Harbor**: An enterprise-grade open-source registry with security scanning, access control, and replication.
        * **JFrog Artifactory**: A universal artifact manager that supports Docker images.
    * **Cloud-Hosted**:
        * **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**
        * **Google Artifact Registry (formerly GCR)**
        * **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**

##### Running a Local Registry

You can easily run a private registry locally for testing or development using Docker's official `registry` image.

1. **Start the local registry container:**

    ```sh
    docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -v /var/lib/registry-data:/var/lib/registry --restart=always --name registry registry:2
    ```

    This starts a registry listening on `localhost:5000`.

2. **Tag an image to point to the local registry:**
    Before you can push an image to this registry, you need to tag it with the registry's host and port.

    ```sh
    # Pull an image (e.g., alpine)
    docker pull alpine
    
    # Tag it for your local registry
    docker tag alpine localhost:5000/my-alpine
    ```

3. **Push the image to the local registry:**

    ```sh
    docker push localhost:5000/my-alpine
    ```

4. **Pull the image from the local registry:**
    You can now pull this image on any machine that can access `localhost:5000`.

    ```sh
    # First, remove the local copies to simulate pulling from scratch
    docker image rm alpine
    docker image rm localhost:5000/my-alpine
    
    # Now, pull from your local registry
    docker pull localhost:5000/my-alpine
    ```

5. **Access the registry API:**
    You can interact with the registry using its HTTP API. For example, to list repositories:

    ```sh
    curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/v2/_catalog
    ```

##### 🚀 Core Commands

| Command           | Description                                       | Example                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `docker login`    | Log in to a Docker registry.                      | `docker login myregistry.example.com`           |
| `docker logout`   | Log out from a Docker registry.                   | `docker logout`                                 |
| `docker pull`     | Pull an image or a repository from a registry.    | `docker pull ubuntu:22.04`                      |
| `docker push`     | Push an image or a repository to a registry.      | `docker push myregistry.com/myapp:1.0`          |
| `docker search`   | Search Docker Hub for images.                     | `docker search nginx`                           |

For testing docker registry use script: [docker-registry-lab.sh](scripts/docker/docker-registry-lab.sh).

#### 🧩 Docker Compose

##### 📘 Docker Compose Command Reference

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and managing multi-container Docker applications using a YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`). 

Below is a structured table of the main commands and their purposes.

**📊 Table: Docker Compose Commands**

| Command                                 | Purpose                                                                               | Example                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ▶️**`docker compose up`**           | Build, (re)create, start, and attach to containers defined in `docker-compose.yml`. | `docker compose up -d`                                                   |
| ⏹️**`docker compose down`**         | Stop and remove containers, networks, volumes, and images created by `up`.          | `docker compose down --volumes`                                          |

**🔎 Explanation**

* **`services`** : Defines containers (`web`, `api`, `db`) that make up the app.
* **`ports`** : Maps host ports to container ports (`8080:80`).
* **`volumes`** :
* Named volume (`db-data`) for persistent DB data.
* Bind mount (`./html:/usr/share/nginx/html`) to serve static content.
* **`build`** : Allows building a custom image from a Dockerfile.
* **`depends_on`** : Ensures service startup order (`api` waits for `db`).
* **`networks`** : Defines an isolated virtual network for communication.

**🚀 Usage**

Start in detached mode

```sh
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f api
docker compose down -v
```

For testing docker compose use examples of services in [apps](apps/).

#### 🌐 Docker Swarm

![swarm-nodes](images/swarm-nodes.png)
*Swarm architecture with manager and worker nodes*

![swarm-services](images/swarm-services.png)
*Swarm services with multiple replicas*

Docker Swarm is Docker's native orchestration tool that allows you to manage a cluster of Docker hosts as a single virtual system. It facilitates the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications across multiple machines.

##### Docker Swarm Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🌐 **Swarm** | A cluster of Docker hosts running in swarm mode. |
| 🤖 **Node** | A Docker host participating in the swarm. Nodes can be either managers or workers. |
| 👑 **Manager Node** | Responsible for managing the swarm's state, scheduling tasks, and maintaining the desired state of the cluster. |
| 👷 **Worker Node** | Executes tasks assigned by manager nodes, running the actual containers. |
| 🚀 **Service** | An abstract definition of a computational resource (e.g., an Nginx web server) that can be scaled and updated independently. |
| 📝 **Task** | A running container that is part of a service. |

##### ✨ Main characteristics

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| ⬆️ **High availability** | Distributes services across multiple nodes, ensuring applications remain available even if a node fails. |
| ⚖️ **Scalability** | Easily scale services up or down to handle varying workloads. |
| 🔄 **Load Balancing** | Built-in load balancing distributes requests evenly among service replicas. |
| 🚀 **Rolling Updates** | Perform updates to services with zero downtime. |
| 😊 **Ease of use** | Integrated directly into Docker Engine, making it relatively simple to set up and manage compared to other orchestrators. |

##### 🐳 Swarm Management Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 👑 **`docker swarm init`** | Initializes a new swarm on the current node, making it the manager. | `docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.1.10` |
| 👷 **`docker swarm join`** | Joins a node to an existing swarm as a worker or manager. | `docker swarm join --token <TOKEN> 192.168.1.10:2377` |
| 👋 **`docker swarm leave`** | Removes the current node from the swarm. | `docker swarm leave --force` |
| 📜 **`docker node ls`** | Lists all nodes in the swarm. | `docker node ls` |

##### 🚀 Service Management Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ✨ **`docker service create`** | Creates a new service in the swarm. | `docker service create --name web -p 80:80 --replicas 3 nginx` |
| ⚖️ **`docker service scale`** | Scales one or more replicated services. | `docker service scale web=5` |
| 🔄 **`docker service update`** | Updates a service's configuration. | `docker service update --image nginx:latest web` |

For testing docker swarm use script: [docker-swarm.sh](scripts/docker/docker-swarm.sh).

#### ☸️ Kubernetes

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

##### 🏛️ Kubernetes Architecture

![Kubernetes Architecture](images/k8s-components.png)

A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called **nodes**, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node. The worker node(s) host the **Pods** which are the components of the application workload. The **control plane** manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster.

###### ✈️ Control Plane Components

The control plane's components make global decisions about the cluster (for example, scheduling), as well as detecting and responding to cluster events.

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **kube-apiserver** | The API server is a component of the Kubernetes control plane that exposes the Kubernetes API. The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane. |
| **etcd** | Consistent and highly-available key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data. |
| **kube-scheduler** | Watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on. |
| **kube-controller-manager** | Runs controller processes. Logically, each controller is a separate process, but to reduce complexity, they are all compiled into a single binary and run in a single process. |
| **cloud-controller-manager** | A Kubernetes control plane component that embeds cloud-specific control logic. The cloud controller manager lets you link your cluster into your cloud provider's API, and separates out the components that interact with that cloud platform from components that only interact with your cluster. |

###### 👷 Node Components

Node components run on every node, maintaining running pods and providing the Kubernetes runtime environment.

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **kubelet** | An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a Pod. |
| **kube-proxy** | A network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster, implementing part of the Kubernetes Service concept. |
| **Container runtime** | The software that is responsible for running containers. Kubernetes supports several container runtimes: Docker, containerd, CRI-O, and any other implementation of the Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface). |

##### 📦 Kubernetes Objects

Kubernetes objects are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster.

| Object | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pod** | The smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy. A Pod represents a set of running containers on your cluster. |
| **Service** | An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. |
| **Volume** | A directory containing data, accessible to the containers in a Pod. |
| **Namespace** | A way to divide cluster resources between multiple users. |
| **Deployment** | Provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. |
| **ReplicaSet** | Ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. |
| **StatefulSet** | Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. |
| **DaemonSet** | Ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod. |
| **Job** | Creates one or more Pods and ensures that a specified number of them successfully terminate. |
| **CronJob** | Creates Jobs on a time-based schedule. |

#### ⎈ Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes.

It helps you manage Kubernetes applications — Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.

##### 🎯 Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Chart** | A Helm package. It contains all of the resource definitions necessary to run an application, tool, or service inside of a Kubernetes cluster. |
| **Repository** | A place where charts can be collected and shared. |
| **Release** | An instance of a chart running in a Kubernetes cluster. One chart can often be installed many times into the same cluster. And each time it is installed, a new *release* is created. |

##### 🚀 Core Commands Kubernetes

| Command | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `helm search` | Search for charts in a repository. | `helm search repo stable` |
| `helm install` | Install a chart. | `helm install my-release stable/mysql` |
| `helm upgrade` | Upgrade a release. | `helm upgrade my-release stable/mysql` |
| `helm uninstall` | Uninstall a release. | `helm uninstall my-release` |
| `helm list` | List releases. | `helm list` |

#### 🏗️ Other Orchestration Platforms

##### OpenShift

**OpenShift** is a family of containerization software products developed by Red Hat. Its flagship product is the OpenShift Container Platform — an on-premises platform as a service built around Docker containers orchestrated and managed by Kubernetes on a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

##### Rancher

**Rancher** is a complete software stack for teams adopting containers. It addresses the operational and security challenges of managing multiple Kubernetes clusters across any infrastructure, while providing DevOps teams with integrated tools for running containerized workloads.

##### Mesosphere DC/OS

**Mesosphere DC/OS** (the Datacenter Operating System) is a distributed operating system based on the Apache Mesos distributed systems kernel. It can manage multiple machines in a datacenter or cloud as if they’re a single computer. It provides a highly elastic, and highly scalable way of deploying applications, services, and big data infrastructure on shared resources.

### Cloud Definition

Cloud is a model for distributed computing that provides on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) via the internet, provisioned and released rapidly with minimal management effort. 

### Cloud Computing Definition

Cloud Computing is the paradigm for delivering IT services through the internet, where computing resources are dynamically allocated based on demand. Instead of investing in local infrastructure, users and organizations access computing power, storage, and applications through subscription or pay-per-use models, with automatic scalability and centralized management.

### Types of cloud

#### Public Cloud

Public cloud refers to cloud computing services offered by third-party providers over the public internet, making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

#### Private Cloud

Private cloud is a cloud computing environment dedicated to a single organization, either hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider. It offers enhanced security, control, and customization compared to public clouds. 

#### Hybrid Cloud

Hybrid cloud combines public and private cloud environments, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This approach provides greater flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency. 

#### Multi-Cloud

Multi-cloud refers to the use of multiple cloud computing services from different providers within a single architecture. This strategy helps avoid vendor lock-in, enhances redundancy, and allows organizations to leverage the best features of each cloud provider.

### IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

#### IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

IaaS provides virtualized computing resources on demand (virtual machines, block and object storage, networking, GPUs). By 2026, IaaS has evolved to include AI-ready infrastructure, automated bare-metal provisioning, and native integration with observability, security, and real-time compliance solutions.

#### PaaS (Platform as a Service)

PaaS offers a managed platform for application development, deployment, and operation without managing underlying infrastructure. In 2026, PaaS includes serverless functions, managed databases, API gateways, native CI/CD, and event-driven and microservices architectures with automatic scaling.

#### SaaS (Software as a Service)

SaaS delivers software applications via web, accessible through browsers or native clients, with subscription-based models. In 2026, SaaS integrates artificial intelligence for automation and insights, provides extensible customization, open APIs for integration, and supports rigorous compliance with zero-trust security.

#### OpenStack

OpenStack is an open-source cloud computing platform that provides IaaS capabilities for private and hybrid cloud environments. In 2026, OpenStack maintains its relevance in corporate datacenters and private cloud providers, offering a complete service stack (Nova for compute, Cinder for block storage, Swift for object storage, Neutron for networking) with advanced support for Kubernetes containers, automatic load balancing, and integration with enterprise-grade security and compliance solutions.

#### Terraform

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that enables infrastructure definition and provisioning in a declarative and versioned manner. By 2026, Terraform is the de facto standard for infrastructure management in multicloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenStack, etc.), with robust support for distributed state, policy as code, reusable modules, and native integration with CI/CD pipelines, GitOps, and compliance automation.
